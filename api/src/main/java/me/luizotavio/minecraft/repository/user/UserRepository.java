/**
 * Main repository to lookup for users based on UUID, name, email or identifier.
 * The identifier can be understood as a snowflake, so it's a unique identifier
 *
 * All methods of this interface are async, so you need to catch some specific exceptions such as:
 *  * {@link UserDoesntExistException} - Thrown when the user does not exist when you are trying to lookup for a user.
 *
 *  You need to catch these exceptions because they are thrown when the future is completed exceptionally.
 *  Otherwise, you can just use the {@link CompletableFuture#join()} method to get nullable values.
