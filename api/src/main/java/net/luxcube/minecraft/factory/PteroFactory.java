/**
 * Main factory to create servers and users.
 * It automatically inserts the user/server into the pterodactyl, so you don't need to mind
 * about inserting it.
 * <p>
 * Most of methods are async, so you need to catch some specific exceptions such as:
 * * {@link UserDoesntExistException} - Thrown when the user does not exist when you are trying to create a server.
 * * {@link EggDoesntExistException} - Thrown when the egg does not exist when you are trying to create a server.
 * * {@link ServerAlreadyExistsException} - Thrown when the server already exists when you are trying to create a server.
 * * {@link UserAlreadyExistsException} - Thrown when the user already exists when you are trying to create a user.
 * * {@link InsufficientResourcesException} - Thrown when the server cannot be created because there is no resources available.
 * * {@link ServerDoesntExistException} - Thrown when the server does not exist when you are trying to delete a server.
 * <p>
 * You need to catch these exceptions because they are thrown when the future is completed exceptionally.
 * Otherwise, you can just use the {@link CompletableFuture#join()} method to get nullable values.
